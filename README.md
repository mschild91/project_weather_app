# Get Your Weather - VanillaStyle

Welcome to **Get Your Weather - VanillaStyle**, a responsive weather website that provides you with up-to-date weather information from around the world. With this web application, you can input the name of a country and a city of your choice to retrieve data on date, time of day, temperature, air pressure, humidity, and wind speed. This was the final project for the vanilla JavaScript part of the SuperCode Bootcamp, and we had 2 days to complete it.

## Technologies Used
This project was built using the following technologies:
- HTML: To structure the web page content.
- SCSS (Sass): For styling the user interface and enhancing CSS.
- Vanilla JavaScript: To handle user interactions and fetch weather data.
  
## Design
The design of this weather website was not predefined. It was carefully crafted by me to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience. We believe that design plays a crucial role in making weather information accessible and enjoyable.
